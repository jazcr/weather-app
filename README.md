## Weather Dashboard App

This simple weather app operates off of the Openweathermap API. When you enter a city name into the search box, the current weather and the future 5 day forecast displays below. 
Your searches are saved on the left-hand side so that you can just click on them to re-display the city's weather.


This app was created using HTML, CSS, and jQuery.
